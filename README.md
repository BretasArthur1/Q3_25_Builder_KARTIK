# Turbin3 Q3 Builder Program

My proof-of-work for the Solana Turbin3 Q3 Builder Program - a comprehensive journey into Solana development with Rust and TypeScript.

## Program Overview

The Turbin3 Q3 Builder Program is an intensive cohort focused on building production-ready applications on the Solana blockchain. This repository contains my implementations and learnings throughout the program.

## Completed Work

### Prerequisites
- Solana development environment setup
- Rust fundamentals for blockchain development
- TypeScript client configuration
- Anchor framework introduction

### Token & NFT Programs
- SPL Token program implementation
- NFT minting mechanisms
- Metadata handling and storage
- Token distribution strategies

### Automated Market Maker (AMM)
- Liquidity pool creation
- Swap functionality implementation
- Price calculation algorithms
- Fee structure integration

### Vault System
- Secure asset storage mechanisms
- Access control implementations
- Withdrawal and deposit logic
- Multi-signature capabilities

## Tech Stack

- **Rust** - Core program development
- **TypeScript** - Client-side implementations
- **Anchor** - Solana development framework
- **Solana Web3.js** - Blockchain interactions

## Upcoming Modules

More advanced topics and protocols will be covered as the program progresses, including additional DeFi integrations and advanced Solana concepts.
