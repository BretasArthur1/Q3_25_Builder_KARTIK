# ðŸ’¸ Zeropolis â€“ Smart Money Circles on Blockchain

Zeropolis is a decentralized ROSCA (Rotating Savings and Credit Association) platform that brings traditional money-saving circles onto the blockchain â€” making them **trustless**, **transparent**, and **fully programmable**.

## Whatâ€™s the Idea?

Imagine a group of friends or community members saving together. Each month, everyone contributes a fixed amount, and one member takes the full pot. This continues until all members have received it once.

With **Zeropolis**, this entire process is automated by smart contracts â€” no banks, no middlemen, and no need to trust anyone.

## Key Features

- **Circle Creation**  
  Set group size, monthly contribution, payout rules (order/random/auction), and entry criteria.

- **Trustless Participation**  
  Members stake collateral, and smart contracts ensure timely payments and fair payouts.

- **Flexible Payout Logic**  
  Predefined, need-based, randomized, or auction-style distributions.

- **Dispute Handling**  
  Defaults are penalized via staked collateral. Members can vote on special cases.

- **On-chain Reputation**  
  Participants build a trust score based on their history across money circles.

- **Security Measures**  
  All funds are escrowed in the contract. Organizers can't claim the first payout.
